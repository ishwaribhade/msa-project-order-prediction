Learning Summary:

I started my learning journey on this topic of AI and ML by attending the MSA workshop followed by the learning modules suggested by the team.  
So far, its been quite a roller coaster ride and I would say that I have a long way to go.
Initially, i took the general learning path provided in the project details followed by the Coding approach to ML.
Still, there are a lot of things to explore with respect to Azure and its services and I am looking forward to learning more.
